# Concert Mangement and Marketplace System

This project is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize concert management by enabling seamless ticket purchases, collectible issuance, and a vibrant marketplace for reselling tickets and collectibles. At its core, the system leverages Solidity to power smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent on-chain operations. JavaScript is employed for rigorous testing of functionalities, while Python facilitates smooth interaction with the smart contracts, acting as a bridge between the blockchain and the user interface. Together, these technologies form a robust and efficient platform for enhancing the concert-going experience.
